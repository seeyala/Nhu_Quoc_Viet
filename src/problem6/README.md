# API Service Module Specification

## Overview
This software module handles the API services for updating and retrieving user scores in a live leaderboard system. It ensures secure and authorized updates to the user's score, provides real-time updates to the front-end, and prevents malicious activities such as unauthorized score manipulation.

## Introduction
The API service handles requests to update a user's score when they complete an action, as well as retrieving the top 10 users based on their scores. This service will include real-time communication (e.g., WebSocket, Server-Sent Events) to ensure the score board is updated live across all connected clients. The API will include security measures to prevent unauthorized access and malicious score manipulation.

---

## System Flow

#### 1. User completes an action (external system event)
- The action will trigger a request to the backend API with the user’s identifier and the points to be added.

#### 2. API receives the score update request
- The backend receives a request with the user’s ID and the points to be added to their score.
- The system authenticates the request and verifies that the points update is valid.

#### 3. Validate the request
- The request is authenticated (using JWT tokens or OAuth2).
- The system checks that the user is authorized to perform the action and update their score.

#### 4. Update the score
- If the request is valid, the system updates the user’s score in the database.
- The score update is stored in a database (relational or NoSQL).
  
#### 5. Notify clients with real-time updates
- After updating the score, the system sends a real-time update to all connected clients via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- Clients can then update their UI to reflect the new leaderboard rankings.

#### 6. Prevent unauthorized access
- Use security checks to ensure only authorized actions are allowed to update the score.

## API Endpoints

#### `POST /api/v1/score/update`
- **Description**: This endpoint accepts a user’s ID and score increase value and updates the score in the database.
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "user_id": "12345",
      "score_increase": 50
    }
    ```
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Score updated successfully",
      "status": "success"
    }
    ```
- **Security**:
    - JWT Token authentication required.
    - The user must be authorized to update their score (authenticated and active).

#### `GET /api/v1/scoreboard`
- **Description**: This endpoint fetches the top 10 users' scores.
- **Response**:
    ```json
    [
      { "user_id": "12345", "score": 150 },
      { "user_id": "23456", "score": 120 },
      ...
    ]
    ```
- **Security**: No authentication required (public endpoint).

---

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Authentication**: Each request will require an authentication token (e.g., JWT or OAuth2) passed in the header.
- **Authorization**: The backend will validate if the user is authorized to update their score. A user can only update their own score; any request attempting to modify another user’s score will be rejected.

---

## Real-Time Score Updates

- **WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: To ensure the leaderboard is updated live, the backend will push score changes to all connected clients in real-time using either WebSocket or SSE.
    - The frontend will open a persistent connection to the backend server for real-time score updates.
    - Whenever a user's score is updated, the backend will broadcast this update to all connected clients to reflect the new score in their views.

---

## Security Measures

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force or spam score updates. Only allow a certain number of score updates per user per time interval.
- **Authorization**: Ensure that score updates can only be initiated by the authenticated user who owns the score. This prevents users from manipulating other users' scores.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Set up detailed logging for each score update, including the user’s IP, the score change, and timestamps. This allows tracking and auditing of any suspicious activities.
- **Input Validation**: Ensure that the score increase values are within acceptable limits (e.g., non-negative, within reasonable bounds).

---

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Ensure unit tests are written for the API endpoints, including:
    - Validating correct score updates.
    - Ensuring unauthorized users cannot modify scores.
    - Ensuring the correct behavior under edge cases (e.g., no score increase, invalid user ID).
  
- **Integration Tests**: Test the integration of the score update service with the database and real-time communication.

- **Security Tests**: Perform penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities, particularly around the authentication and authorization mechanisms.

---

## Notes
- **Database Considerations**: The leaderboard may require optimization if the number of users is large. Indexing by user ID and score would improve performance.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Implement WebSockets or Server-Sent Events carefully to handle large numbers of concurrent connections efficiently.
- **Scalability**: As the service may grow, consider scaling the API service horizontally, using load balancers, and ensuring that WebSocket connections are distributed efficiently.
